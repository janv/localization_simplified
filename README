==Localization Simplified (LocalizationSimplified)

Localization Simplified plugin for Ruby on Rails. Really simple localization. Written by Jesper Rønn-Jensen ( http://justaddwater.dk/ )

The goal is to have a dead simple plugin for one-language (non-english) Rails 
applications. Many of the existing localization / internationalization plugins are 
too big for this and hard to get started with. Just dump this plugin in 
/vendor/plugins/, set your language and off you go.

Unlike the more advanced plugins, you don't have to translate anything in your 
view files. Just use the standard Rails commands you're used to.

The simple approach also makes limits. Make sure you understand them to decide if 
this plugin is right for you.

I use this plugin when creating new projects. Then later in the development 
process I can decide to change to a more advanced localization plugin (if necessary)

===What it does
This plugin modifies the following most used helpers for Rails
* Sets UTF-8 content-type HTTP header
* Sets UTF-8 connection to database 
* Localized monthnames on date_select etc. (changing the order of Y-M-D, where Rails allows)
* Localized ActiveRecord errors (and error headings)
* Localized distance_of_time_in_words
* Localized to_currency (but not changing the order of unit/currency)
* Simple pluralization also available in the lang-file (but currently only used 
  for pluralizing "error"=>"errors" in local language)
* Changes standard Rails methods. In this way, there is no tedious rewrite of 
  localization functions in your view files


===Limitations
* More advanced features are not likely to be available here.
* No translation of models or the like.
* If you want support for multiple languages, use another L10N/I18n plugin, like 
  GLoc or Globalize
* No support for re-ordering datetime_select fields or currency indicators.
	But date_select IS re-ordered. Currently, Rails lacks support of :order on these,
  but it can be done fairly easy and is already implemented in other frameworks.
The reason why I have not reordered the datetime_select fields or currency is that 
it will introduce an unnecessary dependency here (because functions have to be recoded).


===Supported languages
Currently supported languages:
* English (for running test cases and comparing to normal texts)
* German 
* Spanish
* Dutch
* Danish
* Swedish
* Swedish Chef, and Pirate talk (just for the fun of it)
* any other language you want. Just dump your translation in the /lib folder 

===Download code
* Project homepage: http://rubyforge.org/projects/l10n-simplified/
* Subversion access: svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/l10n-simplified
* Browse: http://rubyforge.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/?root=l10n-simplified



===Usage:
in init.rb, set your language. That's it. Now your db connection is running UTF-8 and standard Rails output is localized.

If your view files contains text, you probably also want to save your files as UTF-8.


===Installation:

1) Just copy this plugin into your /vendor/lib folder
2) Choose your lang-file in init.rb (default is Danish because I am Danish)

 

A special note of WARNING: All files here are saved using UTF-8 encoding.
It's not required for working, I guess, but other encodings could bring you in trouble.

 
===TODO 
* Rake task that modifies all view-files and converts them to UTF-8 
* Also a task that modifies all generators to use UTF-8
* Other helpers that need modification 
  (your suggestions and contributions are welcome)
* Add test cases to verify it works properly
* In particular, make a test that compares original Rails texts to the texts of 
  the overridden functions from this plugin
* Modify to_boolean_select_tag with localized true/false?? (normally, I would 
  prefer to use a checkbox for this and NOT a select tag)

===DONE
* Localized time "Wed Aug 23 12:38:22 Romance Daylight Time 2006" =>
                 "onsdag d. 23 august 2006 12:38:22" (Danish)
* Reordering of date_select fields (2006-08-23) 
* Test that plugin works with the Rails version it is installed next to (2006-08-20)
* Added Dutch translation lang_nl.rb, thanks to Jeroen Houben (2006-08-20)
* Added Pirate language lang_pirate.rb, thanks to Tobias Michaelsen (2006-08-18)
* Added Date and Time#to_formatted_s with locale specific strings (2006-08-18)
* Added MIT-license, copied from Ruby on Rails (2006-08-13)
* Added tests for plugin (2006-08-13)
* Localized version of Array.to_sentence (2006-08-09)
* Added test scaffold  (2006-08-09)
* Added swedish language, thanks to Olle Johnsson (2006-08-09)
* Localized version of to_currency helper (2006-08-07)  

===Your help
Feel free to use, translate, modify and improve this code. 
Do send me translations, improvements, etc. I cannot promise to use it, 
but chances are that I will unless it bloats the code here completely or makes 
code harder to maintain.

I added FIXME notes in the code to indicate where I also could use help.

===Credits
This plugin uses a few bits and pieces from other Rails plugins GLoc (http://rubyforge.org/projects/gloc/) and swe_rails (http://opensource.ki.se/swe_rails.html)
